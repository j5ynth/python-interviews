<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

Before we get into anything fancy, we need to learn how to *talk* to Python. 

Almost every Python program you will ever write - whether for an interview, a script, or a real-world application - starts with simple statements that display output and store values.

This chapter focuses on the abosolute essentials. If you already know some of these, treat this as a quick revision. If not, take a few minutes to run the examples and observe.

## The `print` statement

The `print` statement is one of the most frequently used functions in Python. It is used to display  output on the screen and is often the first thing you write when learning a language.

::: {#e51c8769 .cell}
``` {.python .cell-code}
print("Hello, Python")
```

::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}
```
Hello, Python
```
:::
:::


When this line is run, Python prints the text inside the quotes to the output. In interviews, `print` is commonly used to check logic, verify results, or demonstrate how a pience of code behaves.

You can print multiple values at one.

::: {#30c3fbfe .cell}
``` {.python .cell-code}
print("Python", "Interview", "Prep")
```
:::


Python automatically separates them with a space

## Variables and assignments

A variable is used to store data so that it can be reused later. In Python, assigning a value to a variable is straightforward.

::: {#09dec94b .cell}
``` {.python .cell-code}
name = "J5ynth"
age = 5
```
:::


Here, `name` stores a string value and `age` stores an integer. Python figures out the data type automatically, so there is no need to explicitly mention it. 

One important thing to remember: 

> Python is `dynamically` typed.

This means the same variable can point to different types of values at different times.

::: {#a1ad819f .cell}
``` {.python .cell-code}
value = 10
value = "ten"
```
:::


This is perfectly valid Python code.

## Basic data types

Some of the most commonly used data types in Python are:

* `int` - whole numbers
* `float` - decimal numbers
* `str` - text values
* `bool` - `True` or `False`

Examples:

::: {#a48491f0 .cell}
``` {.python .cell-code}
count = 3
price = 99.99
language = "Python"
is_ready = True
```
:::


To check the type of a variable, you use use built-in `type()` function.

::: {#75b897ef .cell}
``` {.python .cell-code}
print(type(language))
```

::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}
```
<class 'str'>
```
:::
:::


This is a common interview question, especially for beginners.

## String formatting with f-strings

Strings are everywhere in Python, and formatting them properly makes your code cleaner and more readable. One of the most popular ways to do this is by using *formatted strings*, also known as f-strings.

::: {#b0c006ed .cell}
``` {.python .cell-code}
name = "J5ynth"
print(f"Hello, {name}")
```

::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}
```
Hello, J5ynth
```
:::
:::


The letter `f` before the string tells Python to evaluate anything inside the curly braces `{}` and replace it with the corresponding value.

This approach is both readable and efficient, and interviewers often expect candiates to be comfortable with it.

## Taking input from the user

Python allows you to take input from the user using `input()` function.

```python
user_name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Welcome, {user_name}")
```

One important thing to note is that 

> `input` always returns a string.

Even if the user enters a number, Python teats it as text unless explicitly converted.

```python
age = input("Enter your age: ")
print(type(age))
```

We will revisit type conversion in later chapters.

## Predict the output

::: {#7c83a1ee .cell}
``` {.python .cell-code}
x = 10
y = "10"

# print(x + x)
# print(y + y)
```
:::


Run the code and compare the result with your expectation. Questions like these frequently appear in interviews to test conceptual clarity.

## Common mistakes to watch out for

* Forgetting quotes around strings
* Mixing strings and numbers without proper conversion
* Assuming `input()` returns a number

These mistakes are normal when learning and easy to fix once you are aware of them.

## Quick recap

In this chapter, you learned how to:

* Use the `print` statement to display output
* Create and assign variables
* Understand basic Python data types
* Format strings using f-strings
* Take input from the user

If these concepts feel comfortable, your are off tto a good start. In the next chapter, we will look at how Python makes decisions using conditional statements.
