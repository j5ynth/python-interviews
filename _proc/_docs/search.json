    "text": "In today’s fast-paced technology landscape, preparing for a new project or job interview can be challenging. This is especially true when someone has not revised core concepts for a long time and suddenly needs to refresh their knowledge before an interview or a technical assessment panel.\nThis book is an attempt to revisit both basic and advanced concepts of Python in a practical and approachable way. While a detailed chapter outline is still evolving, the primary goal is simple: readers should be able to learn by writing and running code examples, and by understanding the output they produce.\nLet us begin with a simple example of a Python function.\n\n\nsay_hello\n\ndef say_hello(\n    to\n):\n\nSay Hello to someone.\nIn Python, the keyword def is used to define a function. Here, the name of the function is say_hello, and it accepts a single parameter named to, which is enclosed in parentheses and followed by a colon (:).\nThe line enclosed within triple/duouble quotes is known as a docstring. It provides documentation about the purpose and behavior of the function and is often used by developers and tools to understand what the function does.\nFinally, the return statement sends a value back to the caller. In this example, an f-string (a formatted string prefixed with the letter f) is used to interpolate the value stored in the variable to into the output string.\nLet us call the function as displayed below with a value.\n\nsay_hello(\"J5ynth\")\n\n'Hello J5ynth!'\n\n\nThe output of the function is displayed above and is enclosed within single quotes (’). This happens because the Jupyter Notebook displays the return value of the function by internally calling Python’s built-in print method. Alternatively, one can explicitly call the print method to display the output, as shown below.\nprint(say_hello(\"J5ynth\"))\nBefore trying to write and run the function on your own, it is recommended to first get accustomed to the basic building blocks of the language.\nIf this introduction served as a useful primer, provided clarity, and motivated you to begin preparing for Python interviews, let us move on to the next chapter. We will start with one of the most fundamental concepts in Python - the print statement.",
