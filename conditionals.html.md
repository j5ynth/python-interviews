# Chapter 2 - Making Decisions


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

In the previous chapter, we learned how to Talk to Python. Now it is
time to make Python think.

In interviews, writing correct conditional logic is more important than
writing long programs. Interviewers often test how cleary you can
express decisions using simple constructs like `if`, `elif`, and `else`.

Let us start with the basics.

## The `if` statement

The `if` statement allows Python to run code only when a condition
evaluates to `True`.

``` python
score = 80

if score >= 80:
    print("You're eligible for interview.")
```

    You're eligible for interview.

If the condition is `True`, the indented block runs. If it is `False`,
Python skips it.

Indentation is not optional in Python. It defines the structure of your
program. This is something interviewers pay close attention to.

## Adding `else`

When you want one block of code to run if a condition is `True` and
another block if it is `False`, you use `else`.

``` python
score = 79

if score >=80:
    print("You're eligible for interview.")
else:
    print("You're not eligible for interview.")
```

    You're not eligible for interview.

## Multiple conditions with `elif`

Sometimes you need to check more than two possibilities. That is where
`elif` comes in.

``` python
score = 75

if score >= 90:
    print("Grade A")
elif score >= 75:
    print("Grade B")
elif score >= 60:
    print("Grade C")
else:
    print("Grade D")
```

    Grade B

Python evaluates conditions from top to bottom at the first `True`
condition

## Comparision and logical operators

Common Comparison operators:

- `==` equal to
- `!=` not equal to
- `>` greater than
- `<` less than
- `>=` greater than or equal to
- `<=` less than or equal to

Logical operators allow you to combine conditions:

- `and`
- `or`
- `not`

Example:

``` python
math_score = 80
passed_english = True

if passed_english and math_score >= 80:
    print("You're eligible for interview.")
```

    You're eligible for interview.

## Truthy and falsy values

Not all conditions are simple comparisons. In Python, certain values are
treated as `False` automatically. These are known as *falsy* values.

Common falsy values include.

- `0`
- `""` (empty string)
- `[]` (empty list)
- `None`
- `False`

Everything else is generally considered `True`.

Example:

``` python
colors = []

if colors:
    print("List of colors is not empty")
else:
    print("List of colors is empty")
```

    List of colors is empty

This is a very common interview concept.

## Predict the output

Try to predict the output of the following code:

``` python

x = 0

if x:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
```

## Common mistakes to watch out for

- Using `=` instead of `==` in conditions
- Forgetting indentation
- Writing overly complex nested conditions when simpler logic would work

Clean and readable conditional logic leaves a strong impression in
interviews.

## Quick recap

In this chapter, you learned how to:

- Use `if`, `elif`, and `else`
- Write comparison expressions
- Combine conditions using logical operators
- Understand truthy and falsy values

With this foundation, you can now control the flow of your programs.

In the next chapter, we will explore loops and learn how to repeat tasks
efficiently.
